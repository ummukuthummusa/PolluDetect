                <h3>What's Pollution</h3>
                <p class="pollution-meaning">
                    Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials 
                    into the environment. These harmful materials are 
                    called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such 
                    as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human 
                    activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. 
                    Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>
